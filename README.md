# Exercise 2: Using geopandas to handle spatial data sets

This week we will practice how to create geometry objects, 
carry out simple geometric calculations, and reproject data sets
using [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/).


- **Exercise 2 is due by Thursday, 17 November 2023, end of day**

- Don’t forget to check out the [hints for this week’s
exercise](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/lesson-2/exercise-2.html#hints)

- Scores on this exercise are out of **20 points**.


## Notes

#### Solution code cells

You can always start working by removing this line of comment: 

```
# ADD YOUR CODE HERE
```

We are checking your solutions semi-automatically. Please use the suggested
variable names when writing your code. 

#### Non-editable code cells

Some of the code-cells are ‘non-editable’ which means that you are supposed to
run them, but you are not able to edit them. These non-editable code cells
should help you test your code while you proceed. 

#### Immediate feedback

Whenever you push and submit your work, an automated process will check your
submission and tell you how many points you have achieved, so far. The feedback
includes a list of possible improvements (unless there is nothing to improve on
anymore, of course ;) ).

You can find this feedback in the [‘Pull Request’](../pull/1) that has been
automatically opened when you [accepted the GitHub classroom 
assignment](#).
